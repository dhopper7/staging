<div class="contentbody" id="body"><p align="CENTER"><img src="images/intro_autocomplete.PNG" /></p><p>jqAutocomplete for PHP is a server-side component built on top of open and widely used standards - jQuery, jQuery UI, ThemeRoller.<p>Autocomplete, when added to an input field, enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.<p>By giving an Autocomplete field focus or entering something into it, the plugin starts searching for entries that match and displays a list of values to choose from. By entering more characters, the user can filter down the list to better matches.<p>This can be used to enter previous selected values, for example you could use Autocomplete for entering tags, to complete an address, you could enter a city name and get the zip code, or maybe enter email addresses from an address book.<p>You can pull data in from a local and/or a remote source: Local is good for small data sets (like an address book with 50 entries), remote is necessary for big data sets, like a database with hundreds or millions of entries to select from.<p><br>
Some of the major features include:<p><ul>

<li> Blazing speed - only the minimal data required is sent from server to client using JSON.<br>
<li> Supports the most popular SQL Databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server.<br>
<li> Supports array data.<br>
<li> jQuery based client-side - familiar and powerful client-side API based on jQuery and jQuery UI.<br>
<li> Feature complete - every feature you might need, including caching,loading data at once and etc<br>
