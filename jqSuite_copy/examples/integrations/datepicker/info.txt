Another very usefull class is the Calender class, which can be used in any
input field.
We have created a method which integrates this class in jqGrid.
You will need only to set the on which field the datepicker should be lunched.
Note that the method automatically converts the user date set in jqGrid to
the appropriate datepicker format.
A various options are available.
In this example Open the edit form and you will see the datepicker icon near to
OrderDate.
