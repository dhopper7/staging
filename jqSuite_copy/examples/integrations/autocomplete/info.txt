The jqAutocomplete class which uses jQuery UI autocomplete is a separate class
which can be used easy in any form.
The class is integrated in jqGrid for PHP and uses a method setAutocomplete.
This is a single line command wich tell on which field to apply autocomplete and
the SQL to obtain the data. There are a lot of option parameters where the method
can be configured.
In this particular example we use the autocomplete only in form editing.
When you lunch the edit form try to write some letter on ShipName field.
