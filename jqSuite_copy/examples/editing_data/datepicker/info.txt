Inline editing is another editing mode of <b>jqGrid</b>. To invoke inline editing, just call the client-side jqGrid <b>editRow</b> method.

In this particular example, we are using the build in formatter "actions" which call <b>editRow</b> on the client-side jqGrid.
Note that we create a datepicker in colModel using the dataInit event. The event occur when the element is created and is ideal
for initial bindings and etc.

Please, refer to the PHP tab for the javascript sample.
