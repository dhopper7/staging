Quick install
=============
This install cover a MySQL database, but it can be applied to to all supported fron jqSuite.
In the future we will provide table definitions for these databases

0. Copy the files from the archive to a directory in your webserver.
Let suppose it is named jqscheduler.

1.Create a table named events in your database where you plan to use the jqScheduler.
The table definition for MqSql is in directory php/backend/db_mysql.sql
If you use other database server use the definition from the file above.
If the table can not be named events (or you have already  such one) rename it in you way and then
after creating the instance do

$eventcal = new jqScheduler($conn);
$eventcal->table ="your_new_table_name";

2. If you can pass the connection to the scheduler skip this step
Open the file jq-config.php and enter the appropriate information for the database user and password.


3. Open the file eventcal.php. 
If you have other table name do the setting as from step 1.

4. Run the application
