You can control a large number of appearance related options using the <b>setGridOption</b> property collection. In this example we take advantage of top pager <b>topppager</b> to create a pager at top of the grid.

You can control the width of the buttons on top pager to be duplicated from the pager <b>cloneToTop</b> property in navigator options.
