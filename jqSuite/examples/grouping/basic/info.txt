You can group rows in the grid by a particular column (field). Just add a groupField to the groupingView collection.

There are numerous properties you can customize in each Group Field:
groupField - the column used for grouping
groupText - the text used for grouping. You can pass the value of the DataField using the {0} argument
groupColumnShow - whether to show the grouping column in the grid or not
