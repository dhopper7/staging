Demonstrates how to use the read from xml file sql commands.
You can store all your predefined sql commands in simple xml file where
every command is identfied by id and then just tell the jqGrid which
file to use and which sql. See the example.

Here in this example we use the following xml file

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
 &lt;queries&gt;
 &lt;sql Id="getProducts"&gt;
  SELECT * FROM products
 &lt;/sql&gt;
 &lt;sql Id="getOrders"&gt;
  SELECT * FROM orders
 &lt;/sql&gt;
 &lt;/queries&gt;
