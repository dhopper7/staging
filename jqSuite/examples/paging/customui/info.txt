You can customize the functionality and UI of the grid pager using the <b>setGridOptions</b> set. You can set the <b>rowNum</b> property to the numbers of row you wish to see in a page (default is 10).

You can also choose the options end-users see in the page-size dropdown. This is a array. For example, to see 5 options 5,10,50 you just have to set <b>"rowList"=>array(5,10,50)</b>
