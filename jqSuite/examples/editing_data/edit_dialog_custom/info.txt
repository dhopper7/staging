By default Edit Dialog places the edit fields vertically, one at a line and in the order columns are defined in the grid. Sometimes we may need to change that. The properties that control this behaviour are available for each JQColumn, example:

$grid->setColProperty('Phone',array("formoptions"=>array("rowpos"=>1,"colpos"=>2)));
$grid->setColProperty('CompanyName',array(
    "formoptions"=>array("label"=>"Company","elmsuffix"=>"(required)"),
    "editrules"=>array("required"=>true))
);

<b>colpos</b> - defines the column position of the field edit control
<b>rowpos</b> - defines the row position of the field edit control

Note that you can have several edit controls on the same line, just make sure they have the same rowpos, but different colpos.

<b>label</b> - the label to display for editing. If not set, the column DataField (column name) is used
<b>elmpreffix</b> - what to display before the edit control
<b>elmsuffix</b> - what to display after the edit control
