One of the ways to edit data is by using the Edit Dialog functionality. You can launch Edit Dialog by selecting a row and then clicking on the "Edit" button in the grid toolbar (bottom left in this example). For this, you need to have toolbar enabled.

By default, columns are editable. To make them not editable, set the <b>editable</b> property of the respective column to false.

You can customize almost any feature of the edit dialog via the <b>setNavOptions</b> for edit dialog (for example <b>Caption, SubmitButtonText,</b> etc)

Please, take a look at the code in the PHP tab for additional details.
