In this advanced example we show one very usefull feature of the autocomplete
method. It is possible to search on one field, but to set the selected value on
on different field.
For this purpose it is only needed to set the target field.
In this particuler exmple - open the edit form and then try to serch on
CompanyName field. After the field is selected and the cursor is moved
you will see that the CustomerID changes.  If there is no selection the
CustomerId field goes empty.
