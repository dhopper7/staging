You can control a large number of appearance related options using the setGridOptions collection. In this example we take advantage of Alternate Row Background  ("altRows"=>true) to toggle whether we like to see odd/even rows with different background or not. This is also sometimes refer to as <b>zebra</b> effect. The alternate background color comes from the current ThemeRoller theme.
