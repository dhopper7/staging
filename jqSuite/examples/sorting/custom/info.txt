In some cases, the default sorting mechanism of jqGrid is not exactly what you need to achieve.
In this case, you can use the onSortCol event to perform your custom sorting and
return the 'stop' which instruct jqGrid not to perform your own sorting.

Please, refer to the PHP code tabs for implementation details.
